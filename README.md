## Description
**Just Pure 2D Graphics Matrix Display** (*JP2GMD*) is a powerful matrix calculator. 

It allows you to perform basic operations on matrices, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It also allows you to perform more advanced operations, such as finding the determinant, the inverse, and the transpose of a matrix.

One of its most powerful features is the ability to generate `LaTeX` code for the matrix you are working with and all the operations you perform on it.
