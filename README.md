## Description
Frobnicator is going to be a platformer game similar to Super Mario Bros made using Bevy game engine.

## Features
- map generator
- shooting
- enemy AI
- game state saving and loading
- scores

## Plan
In the first part we're going to implement the basics: movement, physics and shooting. The enemies will simply bounce from one edge of the platform to the other. There will be only a single map.

In the second part we're going to add random map generator, saving/loading, scores and a more sophisticated AI.

## Libraries
- Bevy
- Serde (for serialization)
